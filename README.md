# major_req_scraper
Finished up this quick little project! Fairly happy with it, it did what I needed it to but I could add some more functionality to the CSV analyzer part and make it more interactive.

A simple web scraper to take UC Davis major requirement info into a csv file for later work. 
A combiner to combine the scraped csv files into a single merged csv file for analysis. Formatted to distinguish classes that you can choose between. 
A very basic analyzer, shows amount of units needed for both majors. Plan on coming back and adding more functionality.
